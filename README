=============================================================================
DEPENDENCE
=============================================================================

rpvm depends on R version 1.2.0 or higher and PVM 3.4.2.
    
=============================================================================
INSTALLATION:
=============================================================================

1.  Install pvm 3.4.3 (http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/pvm.3.4.3.tgz) and set
    environment variable PVM_ROOT to the directory pvm is installed.
    See pvm documentation for details.

    Binary distributions of pvm are available for some platforms (rpm for
    Redhat Linux, deb for Debian GNU/Linux, etc.).

    You need install pvm for each host you want to include in the virtual
    machine.

2.  Install rpvm by usual process:

    R INSTALL rpvm_version.tgz.

    You need install rpvm for each host.

    If PVM_ROOT is not set, the configure script will try to look for
    first /usr/lib/pvm3/ then $HOME/pvm3/ and stop if none exists.

4.  Optional.

    Set environment variables RSLAVEDIR (where to find R slave script, default
    $R_LIBS/rpvm) and RSLAVEOUT (where to put output from R slave process, 
    defalut $TMPDIR).  They can also be specified as option when calling the 
    spawning function.

=============================================================================
TEST:
=============================================================================

The examples in the Rd files are "dummy" examples in that

R CMD check rpvm

won't actually run those examples.  However, there are two scripts in tests
dir which should run successfully if pvm has been installed properly.

Caveat: To be able to run the test successfully, the local host shouldn't be
part of a already running VM (since rpvm may not be installed on other hosts).
After the test, pvmd is left running on the local host (attempts to shut down
the VM with .PVM.halt() in the test R script will abruptly shutdown R itself
and resulted in error exit).
