=============================================================================
DEPENDENCE
=============================================================================

rpvm depends on R version 1.2.0 or higher and PVM 3.4.2.
    
=============================================================================
INSTALLATION:
=============================================================================

1.  Install pvm 3.4.3 (http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/pvm.3.4.3.tgz) and set
    environment variable PVM_ROOT to the directory pvm is installed.
    See pvm documentation for details.

    Binary distributions of pvm are available for some platforms (rpm for
    Redhat Linux, deb for Debian GNU/Linux, etc.).

    You need install pvm for each host you want to include in the virtual
    machine.

    To be able to run tests/hello.R test script, it is assumed that you've
    compiled and run the hello.c/hello_other.c example coming with pvm
    successfully.

2.  Install rpvm by usual process:

    R INSTALL rpvm_version.tgz.

    You need install rpvm for each host.

    If PVM_ROOT is not set, the configure script will try to look for
    first /usr/lib/pvm3/ then $HOME/pvm3/ and stop if none exists.

Assuming rpvm is installed to $R_LIBS,

3.  Copy file $R_LIBS/rpvm/slaveR.sh to $PVM_ROOT/bin or add its directory
    to PVM search path when starting pvmd (with ep= option).

4.  Optional.

    Set environment variables RSLAVEDIR (where to find R slave script, default
    $R_LIBS/rpvm) and RSLAVEOUT (where to put output from R slave process, 
    defalut $TMPDIR).  They can also be specified as option when calling the 
    spawning function.

=============================================================================
TEST:
=============================================================================

The example codes in Rd files won't work by themselves.  To test rpvm,
assume you've done 1 in INSTALLATION and pvmd is up and running, use,

R CMD check --no-examples rpvm

this should run the tests/hello.R script successfully.  hello.R spawns an
executable 'hello_other' as slave task.  If you don't want to run the test
script, use

R CMD check --no-examples --no-tests rpvm

To test R slave, assume you have done 2 and 3 in INSTALLATION, use

R < $R_LIBS/rpvm/demo/pvm_test.R

or

R BATCH $R_LIBS/rpvm/demo/pvm_test.R pvm_test.Rout

It should run smoothly.
