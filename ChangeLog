    * Version 0.3 released.

    * Group functions implemented with a test script.

    * Now the test scripts (pvm_test.R, group_test.R) should run at R CMD
      check with only minimal requirement that pvm is installed properly 
      (no need to specify path, etc.).

    * It is no longer needed to move the slaveR.sh script anywhere.
