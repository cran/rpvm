2005-09-12  Na Li  <nali@umn.edu>
        * DESCRIPTION: updated version to 0.6.5.
        * R/rpvm.R: fixed bug in .PVM.spawn (tid -> tids) (thanks to Mark
        Handcock).
        * Misc: There have been several bug fixes since v0.6.2 (thanks to Kurt
        Kornik).  

2004-05-25  Na Li  <nali@umn.edu>

	* DESCRIPTION: updated version to 0.6.2.
	* R/rpvm.R, src/rpvm_ser.c: revert back to use .PVM.pksexp ().

2004-05-16  Na Li  <nali@umn.edu>

	* DESCRIPTION: updated version to 0.6.1.
	* R/rpvm.R: removed old .PVM.(un)serialize () that uses
	rpvm_ser.c. Removed 'require(serialize)' statements.
	* src/rpvm_ser.c: deleted.

2004-04-15  Na Li  <nali@umn.edu>

	* Version 0.6 released.
	* configure.in: fixed bugs when PVM_ROOT is not defined.
	* DESCRIPTION: updated email info and required R version.
	* tests: removed test scripts.
	* demo: added demo scripts.
	* R CMD check: warnings fixed.
	* PVM.spawn, PVM.spawnR: updated. slaveR.sh now needs to be
	relocated to $PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH or somewhere else pvmd can
	find on each node.  The slave R script is specified using a
	relative path so it can be located on each slave.
	
2002-04-22: Version 0.5.0       Na (Michael) Li <lina@u.washington.edu>

	* Splited rsprng out as a separate library but retain a couple of
	in terface functions to rsprng for convenience.  
	* Added	serialization code by Luke Tierney <luke@stat.umn.edu>.

2002-03-08: Version 0.4.2       Na (Michael) Li <lina@u.washington.edu>
    
	* Fixed a bug in rpvm_spawn where the last element of (char **)
	argv should be NULL.  There were two bug reports (thanks to Kurt
	Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at> and R. Woodrow Setzer, Jr.
	<Setzer.Woodrow@epamail.epa.gov>) about sporadic segfault in
	pvm_pkstr called by pvm_spawn.  Hopefully this will now be fixed.

2002-03-08: Version 0.4.2       Na (Michael) Li <lina@u.washington.edu>

	* Use try () to start pvmd and use .path.package () to locate
	installed files (suggested by Kurt Hornik).

2002-01-30: Version 0.4.1       Na (Michael) Li <lina@u.washington.edu>

	* Now the test scripts (pvm_test.R, group_test.R) should run at R
	CMD check with only minimal requirement that pvm is installed
	properly (no need to specify path, etc.).

	* It is no longer needed to move the slaveR.sh script anywhere.
