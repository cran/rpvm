2002-03-08: Version 0.4.2       Na (Michael) Li <lina@u.washington.edu>
    
    * Fixed a bug in rpvm_spawn where the last element of (char **) argv
      should be NULL.  There were two bug reports (thanks to Kurt Hornik
      <Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at> and R. Woodrow Setzer, Jr.
      <Setzer.Woodrow@epamail.epa.gov>) about sporadic segfault in pvm_pkstr
      called by pvm_spawn.  Hopefully this will now be fixed.

2002-03-08: Version 0.4.2       Na (Michael) Li <lina@u.washington.edu>

    * Use try () to start pvmd and use .path.package () to locate installed
      files (suggested by Kurt Hornik).

2002-01-30: Version 0.4.1       Na (Michael) Li <lina@u.washington.edu>

    * Group functions implemented with a test script.

    * Now the test scripts (pvm_test.R, group_test.R) should run at R CMD

      (no need to specify path, etc.).

    * It is no longer needed to move the slaveR.sh script anywhere.
