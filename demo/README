Demos for the rpvm package:

1. Front ends for C/Fortran PVM slaves

	forkjoin.R :
	hello.R    : 

2. R as front end (initial node) and computing/slave node

	pvm_test.R

Notes:

Under Debian, objects to be spawned should be in ~/pvm3/bin/LINUX.  In
particular, the executables need to be located there.
